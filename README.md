SCREAM is a testing framework for MEAN-stack backends (screamingly fast). It provides conventions for testing user stories (requirements) involving one or multiple users.

## Requirements

1. node v4


## Choose your poison

I really prefer coding tests in CoffeeScript as I think braces are just a waste of
time and ruin readibility. That said, SCREAM is flexible enough that you can mix
an match from one spec to another. So half of your team can code in JS and the other
half in Coffee.
